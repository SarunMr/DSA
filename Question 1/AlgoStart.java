// Maximizing Tech Startup Revenue before Acquisition
// A tech startup, AlgoStart, is planning to get acquired by a larger company.
// To negotiate a higher acquisition price, AlgoStart wants to increase its
// revenue by launching a few high-return projects. However, due to limited
// resources, the startup can only work on at most k distinct projects before
// the acquisition. You are given n potential projects, where the i-th project
// has a projected revenue gain of revenues[i] and requires a minimum investment
// capital of investments[i] to launch. Initially, AlgoStart has c capital. When
// a project is completed, its revenue gain is added to the startupâ€™s total
// capital, which can then be reinvested into other projects. Your task is to
// determine the maximum possible capital AlgoStart can accumulate after
// completing at most k projects.

  int maxCaptital(int k, int c, int revenue[], int investment[]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {

        c += revenue[i];
      }
